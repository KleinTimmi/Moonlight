- Windows 8+

## Assistance and How to Use

A full guide to Spotlight can be found on the [Spotlight Wiki](https://github.com/jupahe64/Spotlight/wiki).

## Compiling from Source

To compile Spotlight you will need to download it to a folder also containing the <a href="https://github.com/jupahe64/GL_EditorFramework">GL_EditorFramework</a> repository.<br>
Or do this <br>
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KleinTimmi/Moonlight.git
git clone https://github.com/jupahe64/GL_EditorFramework.git
```

The folder layout should look like this:<br/>

<br/>
These folders must contain their respective project repositories.
(make sure to get rid of the -master in the end when downloading both)<br/>
After that it should be ready to go.
